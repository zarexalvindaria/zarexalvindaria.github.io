# Portfolio Page

This portfolio page contains my featured works and certifications ([zarexalvindaria.github.io](https://zarexalvindaria.github.io)). 

Powered by [Angular](https://angular.io), [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/), and GitHub pages, this portfolio project is divided into several subcomponents namely **Header**, **Projects**, **Education** (+ Certifications) and **Footer**. 

The main object found in the main app component (app.component.ts) has all the variables used in the entire page.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.


## Running & Customization

The main object found in the main app component (app.component.ts) has all the variables and are easily customizable.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
